        for value changes; to achieve a proper UI rendering objective along with the application's 
        intentioned state synchronicity || state: ${root.state.state} || Absolutely rendering a "state
        of the art", and modern Internet application achieving a high level of performance: this coupled with
        a proper integration of design and development through a proper understanding/implementation of the Web Component
        architecture. Maintaining the state of the application with as few changes as possible. This is achieved with applied
        best practices and techniques such as: 
            a)  connectivity and wiring are schematized limiting encorporation to data-binding, event-binding, and property-binding:
                thus allowing the application to be more flexible and scalable by not waisting resources with a properly
                implemented UI and Rendering architecture which allows the application an added, dependable sense from which
                it naturally knows the "STATE" of the application, can count on its intended behavior, absolutely knows its progression,
                and thus rendering the proper UI also all the while correlating styles and mark-up of every rendered element.
                b) utilizing the shadow DOM gives the design and architecture of the application an unfathomed leverage
                not even considered in the development of Web sights: and the aspiration of developers for so long to 
                leverage capable tools and technologies which empower software engineers to equal and finally surpass
                the limitations of a traditional computer desktop program. Yes, I implied that Internet Applications; and I prefer
                terming them an Internet Application versus a seemingly presupposed limited underrated Web Application; anyway, I'm implying that the future of 
                Internet Applications will be a combined:  a. saddling 5G and greater bandwidth, b. an infinite distributory of endpoints 
                and device interfacing thus creating a boundless and intuitive networking vision.      


      
                
                A vision that possesses (through the natural 
                progressive advancement of human born technologies: that are so conceptually engineered that even their purposed implementations
                spawn an enormous flux of new ideas and inventions! anyway, getting back to the progression of a super-enhanced and ingredient-combined
                compilation naturally generating this network: gendering a networking reality that motivates seeded minds and visionaries)this vision 
                possesses a dynamo of grown strength's and properties, who's sole limitation is that of the human mind; that same mind which created it: 
                this along with the already suggested leverage, the dynamicies of properly written software are open conduits for humanity's future inventions. 
                Implementation of properly architectured program languages engenders further intuitive designs and concepts. Software engineering
                is the enabler, and thus the future of invention. Properly defined and demonstrated, software engineering is
                too modern invention, progression,  and any, if not all of mankind's future advancement; as speech, the spoken word, 
                humanities manifested applied thought, was to our rising status from a simple existence as a weaker vessel amongst
                many stronger vessels in the animal kingdom, to a dominant and top-tiered force amongst this planet's creatures. Our thought,
                coupled with the ability to communicate and distribute that thought (speech, vocality and implementation of our thought)
                was the enabler. This processing and enabling created a safer environment for us, and combined seperate individual 
                dynamics to become a collective dynamo whose sum creates the dynamic of progression: manifesting an enablement 
                that I firmly believe will be the continuity of the human species and race. This enabler will find humanity possessing the stars
                and becoming a multi-planetary species' that's then enabled and progressively propped to shine as a
                genuine "Stellar Race". A stellar race of visionaries who conquered their fear: a fear born of ignorance. A fear
                that humanity conquered through enablement. A human thought that provoked in us speech. Advancing still,
                humanity harnessed their vocality thereby training the animal. Training the human animal to add, and compile
                the sum of their advancement, which in turn became the very enabler that generated the motivation to create
                and build something needful. And this therefore propelled humanity yet further along this progressive trail of
                humanities destiny. Brown demonstrated this perfectley by his written speech, "a man's reach must exceed his grasp, 
                or what's a heaven for?" This simple parable is one that helps motivate us and propel us forward in
                this progression.  Stellar technologies for a stellar race of human beings: a wonderful and bright future for humanity.
                Notwithstanding, if God would so choose, to bring His great compilation of thought to a close and fulfill
                the promises that are engraved in our conciousness through both His spoken, and His written word. Talk about enablement,
                and the future of humanity, and the future of the planet: oh well, believers and non-believers alike, 
                we'll have to save this for another day.
                
                Let me terminate with this, a coming full-circle I suppose: an understanding of our future. This future hold's 
                within it a special place. A place that only the Internet can possess. Furthermore, we have an understanding of the
                potentiallity of the Internet. This dynamo of enabling power now offers humanity a tool. Perhaps the only present-day tool,
                in our possession, that is capable of fulfilling the dreams and visions of which humanity hold's collectively. We can 
                create a new world. A world that would appear magical, even to just one prior generation. Arthur C. Clarke spoke it well
                when he penned; "any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." 
                
                The Internet possesses the dynamic of the future. The Internet is the future. It hold's the ingredients that
                potentially can bring magic to our future. We, the software engineers, the software developers, the communicators
                that stand between a dichotomy of humanties future outcomes. There's really only two types of outcomes:
                One is a bad future which lacks any forward momentum and magic; and the other is a good and bright future: 
                a magical future and descriptive of one who's players understood the game. Players who learned the rules of the game,
                and studied its strategies. Players who grasped the potential of the game's equipment and abilities. Players who
                then practiced and studied, then learned some more while coupling their gain with more practice.

                These players learned to communicate with the language of the Internet. They understood the infinite possibilities
                of the Internet: one might say, "what constituted these possibilities?" One, who had understanding in the language,
                and also the clear vision of its implementation would reply: "a constitution of its sum is relative I would suppose.
                This relativeness having dependencies which correctly depend upon the point, or origin if you will, of view. The one
                standing to the left of dichotomy would lack forward momentum. Safely, they would inject the language of yesterday 
                that seemed to have worked out just fine. They would would say, 'look to where this thought as brought us to today.'
                Without remorse, the one who stood to the right of the dichotomy senses no magic. He would go on to say, 'I, and those
                present here by my side, feel no magic in this contemporary status quo. We choose to press on, forward we must go to 
                each and every endpoint of the Internet. We feel a yearning for helping all those device manufacturers and way and the means
                to connect, communicate, and interact with the world.' VIA the ever-far-reaching-arms of the Internet, and we can 
                help all those fulfill their visions of the future. Thereby, in the process, new and improved technologies that fully
                understand that necessity is the father of invention. Along with the progress of invention comes the magic. The magic
                that comes from building all those routes out, finding and catching all those endpoints, believe it or not,
                in the sweet by and by, as we developed while traversing the process, surprise, along came invention. Magically too,
                within the process of invention I found intuition. This knowledge-based intuitiveness is what brings the magic.
                
                Software developers who see the potential of the Internet, and who are able to understand the language of the Internet,
                and who in turn prepare themselves in all aspects of that language, will excel and create the magic of tomorrow.
